## Google Web Starter Kit Branch 


Redesign of the Arcade Creek Project Website.

Team: 

Check out the Wiki for updates and resources. 

Use the issue tracker to submit ideas, features, etc for team consideration.

How to Work on this Project:
Start by forking the repository to your account. This gives you a personal copy of the project that you can work on whenever you want. When you create new features, add code, fix bugs, etc and feel that your work should be added to the main project, create a pull request to submit your code to the Web Senior Manager for consideration. The entire team will evaluate code, but the Web Senior Manager is responsible for managing the full project.
